                <p>2025 has been the most eventful year ever for me. I finished my first year of college, lived in Italy for 2 months, traveled through 5 different countries and lost a friend I’ve known since Highschool. One of my goals this year was to be busier— I can say that it was completed. </p>

                <p>It’s strange to notice yourself changing. My screen time was cut in half this year, I’m more politically motivated than ever, but less angry because I understand hate won’t fix anything. I’ve become much more confident, I feel like this year has been a simmering ego death. Having a friend pass away is strange. Especially since we’re so young. It’s sobering. I’ve been moving spontaneously. Even the way I text is different. Ashley was the most punk rock person I know— I think that’s given me confidence. Anytime I’m scared, she motivates me to keep moving.</p>

                <p>A common theme over this break for me has been hobbymaxxing. I started a Minecraft server; it took me a while to get it to happen. I also finally wrote a script for a short film. I’ve wanted to make a short film since the beginning of this year. Every time I work on the script I try to make it easier to accomplish. Just make it exist. I finished shooting the first scene yesterday, the 12th. It’s strange how easy it is to just do something. I put a monster in the script which was an ambitious choice. The only way I could figure out how to make a monster was to make a puppet. That’s been my 3rd hobby, I guess. Now I'm making a puppet. The next hobby would be starting a blog.</p>

                <p>I’ve also been dating. He’s a vegan who goes to Brown. We still don’t know if we can keep dating once school starts—and once school ends again I leave for Italy. But I like him, he keeps me woke. He took me to a dinosaur train exhibit at the botanical garden</p>

                <p>This entire break feels like limbo. Will I feel like a different person when school starts again? Will I find the time to finish filming my short film once I pass the rubicon? I hope things aren’t too hard on Spring Thomas. At least I have Heated Rivalry.</p>

                <p>Since it’s the new year I want to list my 12 new years wishes. One for each grape I ate before 12:01.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Make short film</li>
                <li>Find a way to make money with short film(even if its 20$)</li>
                <li>Submit short film to festival</li>
                <li>Go to Italy again</li>
                <li>Write a speech</li>
                <li>Wake up earlier</li>
                <li>Read more</li>
                <li>Learn a bit of Spanish(August-December)</li>
                <li>Learn how to cook 5 dishes (bonus points if vegan)</li>
                <li>Dye hair/cut hair first time</li>
                <li>do well in school</li>
                <li>Journal at least 3 times.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>The last wish is why I am doing this. Maybe I’ll journal on my own. But I think more people need to make blogs, I hate Instagram. Be the change you want to see in the world.</p>
